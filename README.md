# Cartman
External CS:GO cheat written for Windows with a basic GUI

### Features
- Glow ESP

### Offsets:
The offsets will be out of date!!    
This program uses my offsets that are gathered with [*Gold Digger*](https://github.com/IVBecy/gold_digger), just place `csgo.h` file
that Gold Digger gives you and put it into `/headers`.    
After that, simply compile!

### Compilation:
Open *cartman.sln* and change the build config to `Release | x86` and press build.
At the end you should receive `cartman.exe`

### How to use:
When in game, just run `cartman.exe` with admin priviligies.     
You can then navigate the GUI.
